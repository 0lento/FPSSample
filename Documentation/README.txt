Greetings traveller! Welcome to the sample game project. This text will
help you build and launch the game and navigate the project.

You can always open this text from the "SampleGame" menu.


0. What is this?
================

This is a sample game project developed internally at Unity. It is a first
person multiplayer shooter game with authorative server, client side pre-
diction etc. It targets PC (steam) and consoles.

Once finished, the project will be made available to all Unity customers to
use as starting point / inspiration / learning.


1. Getting started
==================

From the "SampleGame" menu, open up the "Project Tools" window open.
You will use this all the time, so keep it docked. This window contain
tools to quickly navigate to the levels of the game as well as building
and launching the game in various multiplayer configuration.

Build the bundles. Then build the game.

You can now run the (standalone) game by selecting a level, a mode
(e.g. Multiplayer), number of clients and if the editor should be
one of the participants.

If you just want to run around in a level, you can open it from the
Project Tools window and hit the 'normal' play in the editor. This
takes you to "preview mode" for testing.
